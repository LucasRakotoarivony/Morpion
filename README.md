# Morpion
Game of the morpion created with PHP. It can be found online at the following URL: http://users.polytech.unice.fr/~rl601169/adw/accueil.php (to be tested under Mozilla preferably).  
This is the first computer project I’ve done in 2018. I think since then I’ve become able to do much better.
